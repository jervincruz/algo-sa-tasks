*Question 1*: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hi George,

Of course! Glad you asked since these are some of the fundamental topics we have here at Algolia to fully understand your search experience. Records are essentially the pieces of data we require from businesses, ideally in a JSON format. This data can then be searchable and associated with a given index, for easibility of searching. Deep diving further into the search experience, custom ranking helps our clients achieve a better search experience by prioritizing specific attributes to be returned first. Generally these attributes are the item's number of likes, sales, ratings, views, etc. This allows for people to be retained within your website due to the relevancy of products shown, leading to increased sales and conversions.

Let me know if this paints a great picture! I'd love to go further if there's any gaps that you'd like me to fill.

Thanks,
Jervin

*Question 2*: Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

Hi Matt,

Apologies for the inconvenience that our dashboard may have regarding the updated User Experience. Here at Algolia, we constantly
try to improve not only our backend, but especially the way how our clients interact with the platform. We prioritize ease of use and practicality -- with that said, I'd love to take this to our Product and UX Team and update you further. We take all types of constructive feedback seriously so I greatly appreciate your thoughts on this.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help on our side in the mean time!

Thanks,
Jervin

*Question 3*: Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo

Hi Leo,

Appreciate the question here! At Algolia, we do our best to streamline your process as efficient and time effective as possible.
Holistically, this comprises of two steps: getting your data in the proper format within our infrastructure, and then setting up
the necessary searching within your application itself by using our InstantSearch library. Here is a link to our quick start
that articulates what this looks like, just to get a quick visual with regards to our platform: https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/quick-start/

If you'd like additional info, please do not hesitate to reach out and I can explain this further! I'd be happy to set up a meeting regarding the different ways to setup Algolia within your system!

Thanks,
Jervin
